# swe_dev
repo for personal SWE development

This repo is used to testout and further develop my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. If a project expans beyond a basic comprehension and is to becom its own stand alone project they will be made into their own seperate repo, this is more for learning and understanding basic and underlying concepts behind the software development cycle.
