This read me is to compile notes as a go along my journey of fine tuning my model to best predict values.


# Future Implementations
First and foremost I plan to eventually feed in the data relating to holidays/special observances/ sporting events/ religious events in to my model to help increase accuracy.

## NLP
### i plan on figuring out the best method to convert a set of words to a real number to be able have my model parse things. Hopefully this addition and the bug fixing to ensure it properly works will help in the models sense of accuracy and increase predictions. At the moment there is nothing concrete set for how to go about this however, I am currently considering a bag of words or frequency as a way. They main thing is that i have to considered the uniqueness of the word and if two different groups are connected to one entry. Much to consider for now I will update when I come closer to a solution i like and feel suits this project best.


# Current notes

## model tuning
### This is a giant overview on my findings after running the model throught a few test to summarize how to best run the model(for deeper analysis it can be found in finding on testing(#findings on testing))
